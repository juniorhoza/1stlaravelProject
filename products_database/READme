happy to see you again

so! in this folder you can see the database use to build this project

the database has been exported  in different formats , so choose the one you feel more comfortable .

as it has been said in the initial readme file ,

the two main tables used for this project are Products and Products_images

the products table contains the name of the product, the price, the quantity, the description of the product and the day the product was purchased

on the other hand the Products_images table contain the image of a particular product  and a foreign_id which is used to identify a product

the two tables have a one-to-one relationship : this means that a product  in the products table  is linked to only one image in the product images table

the two databases react to changes which is means that if a product is deleted , the corresponding entry in the product_images table will be deleted equally
